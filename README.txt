Take your blog to a whole new level by converting it to a magazine app for Android, iPad and the iPhone.

== Description ==

= All it takes is just 3 minutes... to take your blog to a whole new level by converting it to a magazine app for Android, iPad and the iPhone. =

**Reinvent your blog on mobile - you need an app!**

These days people read mostly on smartphones and tablets. And you should be where your readers are - on their devices. On their home screens. You should have direct contact with your readers... and push your content to them.

With the Remag plugin you can convert your blog to a magazine app in 3 steps... and 3 minutes:

**Step 1. Install this plugin and activate it**

**Step 2. Create your first issue - bundle a few articles from your blog**

Thanks to this plugin you'll be able to just easily pick the posts you want for the next issue of your digital magazine app.

**Step 3. Preview your app and publish the very same day!**

Let us know you're ready from within our platform and we'll take it from here and publish your apps right away.

= Reconnect with your readers... and get more of them! =

Over the years, you've managed to attract a nice readership to your blog, but you know that very often people just read one article and go... and never come back.

A mobile app is a chance for you to be in touch with them without asking for their email address or anything like that. Thanks to Remag you can have a mobile app just like the popular Productive! Magazine or the Nozbe app's magazine.

= Now every serious blogger can afford an app on the App Store! =

With Remag you can shape the future of digital mobile publishing.
